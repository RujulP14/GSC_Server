## Introduction

This API provides functionality to manage NGOs and user registrations. It is built using Golang with the Gin framework and integrates with Firebase for authentication and Firestore for data storage.

## Features

- User creation, update, retrieval, deletion and login
- NGO creation, update, retrieval, deletion and login

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)
- [Gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/server-api.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

```bash
   cd server-api
```

3. **Setup default credentials:**

```bash
   gcloud auth application-default login
```

4. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
   go mod download
```
5. **Make a .env file**:
   - Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project. This file will contain the API key required for Gemini integration.
   - Visit [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/) to obtain an API key.
   - Store the API key in the `.env` file in the following format:
   - Add your custom port if there is any.
   .env.example
     ```
     API_KEY="yourApiKey"
     PORT=7878
     ```
